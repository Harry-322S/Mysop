Here is how you can manually install Python 3 on CentOS 6.5:

Download the Python 3 source code from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) to your local system.

Extract the downloaded tar file:

ruby
Copy code
$ tar xvf Python-3.x.y.tar.xz
Change to the extracted directory:
shell
Copy code
$ cd Python-3.x.y
Run the configure script to prepare the build environment:
shell
Copy code
$ ./configure
Build and install Python 3:
go
Copy code
$ make
$ sudo make install
Verify the installation by checking the version:
ruby
Copy code
$ python3.x -V
Please note that you need to have the required dependencies and build tools installed on your system, such as GCC, make, and the development headers for libssl and libffi.
