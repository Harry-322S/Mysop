i have a lot of hosts

If you have a lot of hosts, you can define them in an Ansible inventory file and then reference the inventory in your playbook. Here's an example inventory file:

python
Copy code
[all_hosts]
host1
host2
host3
...
And here's an example playbook using the inventory file:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Check Connection
  hosts: all_hosts
  tasks:
    - name: Wait for SSH
      wait_for:
        host: "{{ ansible_host }}"
        port: 22
        delay: 5
        timeout: 60
        state: started
        username: "{{ remote_username }}"
        password: "{{ remote_password }}"
To run the playbook, use the following command:

php
Copy code
ansible-playbook check_connection.yml --extra-vars="remote_username=<username> remote_password=<password>" -i <path_to_inventory_file>
