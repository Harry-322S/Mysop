You can create a local repository using an ISO image that has been mounted on your CentOS system. Here are the steps to follow:

Create a directory where you want to store the repository. For example, you can create a directory named myrepo in the root directory:


sudo mkdir /myrepo

Mount the ISO image to the directory you just created. For example, if the ISO image is located at /path/to/iso/image.iso, you can mount it to the myrepo directory like this:

 mount -o loop /dev/sr0 /mnt
 
sudo mount -o loop /path/to/iso/image.iso /myrepo

This will mount the ISO image to the myrepo directory so that you can access its contents.

Create a repository configuration file for the local repository. You can create a file named myrepo.repo in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory with the following content:


[myrepo]
name=Local Repository
baseurl=file:///myrepo
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

This file specifies the name of the repository, the URL of the repository (which is the path to the mounted ISO image), and whether the repository should be enabled or disabled. The gpgcheck parameter is set to 0 to disable GPG checking.

Save the myrepo.repo file and exit the text editor.

Update the Yum cache by running the following command:


sudo yum clean all && sudo yum makecache

This will clear the Yum cache and rebuild it with the new local repository configuration.

You can now use Yum to install packages from the local repository. For example, you can install the httpd package with the following command:


sudo yum install httpd

Yum will download the package from the mounted ISO image and install it on your system.

That's it! You have successfully configured a local repository using an ISO image that has been mounted on your CentOS system.
