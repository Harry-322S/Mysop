
radius server installation ubuntu 20.04
Here are the steps to install a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server on Ubuntu 20.04:

Install the FreeRADIUS package by running the command:
Copy code
sudo apt-get install freeradius freeradius-utils
Create a new user and group to run the FreeRADIUS service by running the command:
Copy code
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --group freerad
Configure the FreeRADIUS service to use the new user and group by editing the file /etc/freeradius/radiusd.conf and changing the "user" and "group" settings to "freerad".

Create a new client configuration file in /etc/freeradius/3.0/clients.conf and add the details of the client systems that will connect to the RADIUS server.

Create a new users file in /etc/freeradius/3.0/users and add the details of the users that will be authenticated by the RADIUS server.

Start the FreeRADIUS service by running the command:

Copy code
sudo systemctl start freeradius
Enable the FreeRADIUS service to start automatically at boot by running the command:
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable freeradius
Verify that the RADIUS server is running by running the command:
Copy code
sudo systemctl status freeradius
Please note that this is a basic installation and configuration of RADIUS server, you will need to adjust the settings to match your specific environment and configure clients and users as needed.
Also, it is worth mentioning that you should use a secure method to store the passwords, such as using a salted hash or encrypting them using a tool like ansible-vault.

To update FreeRADIUS to the latest version on CentOS 7, you can follow these steps:

Download the latest version of FreeRADIUS from the official website:

ruby
Copy code
wget https://fossies.org/linux/misc/freeradius-server-3.2.2.tar.gz

This will download the latest version of FreeRADIUS to the current directory.

Extract the downloaded archive using the following command:

Copy code
tar xvfz freeradius-server-latest.tar.gz
Change into the extracted directory using the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd freeradius-server-*
Install the required dependencies for building FreeRADIUS using the following command:

Copy code
sudo yum install -y openssl openssl-devel pcre pcre-devel libtalloc libtalloc-devel libnl3 libnl3-devel libtool
Configure the build using the following command:

javascript
Copy code
sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-openssl --with-system-libtalloc --with-system-libnl
This will configure the build to install FreeRADIUS to the /usr/local directory and use the system libraries for libtalloc and libnl.

Build and install FreeRADIUS using the following commands:

go
Copy code
sudo make
sudo make install
This will build and install FreeRADIUS to the directory specified in the --prefix option during configuration.

Verify the installation by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
/usr/local/sbin/radiusd -v
