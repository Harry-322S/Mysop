2).Create the luns as mentioned below on Hitachi SAN.    1) 300GB*1 = 300GB 							
3)Than  add these luns to CRMBOX3 hostgroup  IP control domain 192.168.169.67  and mapping to LDOM OBRMDB RAC1 172.23.26.205
Than  add these luns to CRMBOX5 hostgroup  IP control domain 192.168.169.78  and mapping to LDOM OBRMDB RAC2 172.23.26.215							
4)Than Login to control domain  and follow the steps mentions below do a scan of disks

In BOX5 							
1.echo | format see new raw disks added							
2.cfgadm –al –o show_FCP_dev  for scanning disks							
3.format WWN NO							
4. ldm add-vdsdev /dev/rdsk/WWN NO NAME@primary-vds0(Name on CD side)							
5. ldm add-vdisk NAME  NAME@primary-vds0 PRODBRMDB2 (as per ldm list Name on Ldom side)							
6. ldm list-constraints primary | grep NAME							
7. ldm list-constraints PRODBRMDB2 | grep NAME							
 
IN BOX3
4. ldm add-vdsdev /dev/rdsk/WWN NO NAME@primary-vds0(Name on CD side)
5. ldm add-vdisk NAME  NAME@primary-vds0 PRODBRMDB1 (as per ldm list Name on Ldom side)
6. ldm list-constraints primary | grep NAME	 
7. ldm list-constraints PRODBRMDB1| grep NAME
