To add a route in windows:

Type route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 <gateway>, where <gateway> is the gateway address listed for network destination 0.0.0.0 in Activity 1.
 For example, if the gateway was 192.168.1.1, you would type "route -p add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1." Then press Enter.
Type ping 8.8.8.8 to test Internet connectivity. The ping should be successful. If not, repeat Activity 2 and then use 
ipconfig /renew to update your DHCP-assigned IP address and default gateway.
Close the command prompt to complete this activity.
-p = persistant

To add a route in Linux
$ ip route add <network_ip>/<cidr> via <gateway_ip>

# Example
$ ip route add 10.0.3.0/24 via 10.0.3.1
