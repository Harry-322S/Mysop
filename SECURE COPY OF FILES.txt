SCP:Secure Copy:I already set the without password of ssh for 192.168.246.130
                Means while copy to root directory it will not ask password else(other user) ask password
    Create a file:
     touch file1
    Copy the file from one server to other server:
     scp file1 192.168.246.130:/root/
         (hear file1 is the filename and 192.168.246.130 is the other server ip address)
     scp file2 192.168.246.128:/root/
         (copy into the 128 server)
     scp file3 Sree@192.168.246.130:/home/Sree/
         (before copy the file it will ask password and then copy into the user Sree and directory 128 server)
         (It will not allow to copy the file into user home directory)
