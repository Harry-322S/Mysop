To install the FTP server in CentOS, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal window on your CentOS server.

Install the FTP server package by running the following command:


sudo yum install vsftpd

Once the installation is complete, start the FTP server service by running the following command:


sudo systemctl start vsftpd


You can check if the FTP service is running by running the following command:

sudo systemctl status vsftpd

If the service is running, you should see the message "Active (running)" in the output.

To enable the FTP service to start automatically at boot time, run the following command:


sudo systemctl enable vsftpd

By default, the FTP server allows anonymous login. If you want to disable anonymous login and require authentication for all users, you can edit the configuration file by running the following command:


sudo vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

Find the line that reads "anonymous_enable=YES" and change it to "anonymous_enable=NO". Save the file and exit the editor.

Restart the FTP server for the configuration changes to take effect:


sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

That's it! Your FTP server is now installed and running on CentOS. You can use an FTP client such as FileZilla to connect to your server and transfer files.





How to give access for a particular foldar and particular user through ftp

To give access to a particular folder for a specific user through FTP in CentOS, you can follow these steps:

Create a new user account for FTP access:


sudo useradd -d /home/ftpuser -s /sbin/nologin ftpuser

This creates a new user account named "ftpuser" with the home directory "/home/ftpuser" and with no login shell.

Set a password for the new user account:


sudo passwd ftpuser

Create a new directory for the FTP user:


sudo mkdir /var/ftp/files

This creates a new directory "/var/ftp/files" which will be used for FTP access.

Change the ownership of the directory to the FTP user:


sudo chown ftpuser:ftpuser /var/ftp/files

Edit the FTP configuration file:

sudo vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

Add the following lines at the end of the file:


user_sub_token=$USER
local_root=/var/ftp/files/$USER
chroot_local_user=YES

These lines will configure the FTP server to use the home directory of the FTP user and chroot the user to their home directory.

Restart the FTP service:


sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

Now you can connect to the FTP server using the FTP client and the new user account. The user will only have access to the "/var/ftp/files/ftpuser" directory.

That's it! You have now given access to a particular folder for a specific user through FTP in CentOS.
