Rsync command uses


to copy to a remote server

rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/source/ user@remote_host:/path/to/destination/

-avz and -e ssh are command line options used with rsync to specify how the data should be transferred and over which protocol.

-a: This option stands for "archive" and is equivalent to specifying -rlptgoD. It preserves the permissions, ownership, modification time, group, and other attributes of the files being transferred.

-v: This option stands for "verbose" and displays detailed information about the progress of the transfer, including the list of files being transferred, their sizes, and transfer rates.

-z: This option enables compression during the transfer, which can reduce the amount of data sent over the network and speed up the transfer.

-e: This option specifies the remote shell to use for the transfer. In this case, ssh is used to establish a secure shell connection between the local and remote servers.

By combining these options, rsync will transfer the data recursively while preserving the file attributes and using compression to speed up the transfer. The transfer will be done securely over SSH.

To set up password-less authentication for rsync transfers, you can use SSH key pairs. Here's how to set it up:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

ssh-copy-id user@remote_host

To test the connection

ssh user@remote_host

To schedule a cronjob

0 0 * * * rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/source/ user@remote_host:/path/to/destination/



0 */6 * * * rsync -avz /var/www/html/ root@10.100.102.71:/var/www/html/
