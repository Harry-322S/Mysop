CONFIGURATION OF SSH::
Configure the SSH:
      Open the two putty to with differnt ip address
        Putty1:ifconfig(display the ip address of the current system like 192.168.246.128)
        putty2:ifconfig(display the ip address of the current system like 192.168.246.130)     
      Ping to connect the other server
        putty1: ping 192.168.246.130 then press 'Ctl+c'
      SSH:With password:Now Iam running in 192.168.246.128
                       putty:ssh 192.168.246.130
                           The authenticity of host '192.168.246.128 (192.168.246.128)' can't be established.
                           RSA key fingerprint is ae:68:5e:3c:17:ea:f2:51:8e:0f:05:1d:2a:73:01:69.
                           Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
                           Then press 'yes'
                         It will ask password of the 192.168.246.130 server
                         Its automatically connected the 192.168.246.130 server
          Passwordless:Now Iam running in 192.168.246.128
                       ssh-keygen -t rsa
                           Generating public/private rsa key pair.
                           Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):Enter
                           Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):Enter
                           Enter same passphrase again:Enter
                           Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
                           Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
                           The key fingerprint is:
                           71:da:6b:76:5b:a9:6b:34:39:84:98:4e:be:7a:20:15 root@localhost.localdomain
                           The key's randomart image is:

                           1st Enter:create the path
                           2nd Enter:Password enable
                           3rd Enter:again password enable
                        ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 192.168.246.130
                          It will ask password of 192.168.246.130 server
                          Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh '192.168.246.130'", and check in:
                          .ssh/authorized_keys
                          to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.
                        ssh 192.168.246.130(Now it will not ask password)
